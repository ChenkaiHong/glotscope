"""Word segmentation adapters (PRD §7.1, §10.3, D6).

``W(D)`` is the single largest source of silent incomparability in this
literature, so these tests are mostly about refusals: a missing extra, a
segmenter used outside the language it was built for, and a segmenter that is
not written yet must each fail loudly and differently. The one thing none of
them may do is quietly fall back to whitespace.

Every adapter is exercised against the real library. A test that mocked the
segmenter would assert that glotscope calls a function, which is not the part
that goes wrong — what goes wrong is the version pinned in the manifest and the
segmentation the library actually returns.
